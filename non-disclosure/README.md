# Guidelines for people presented with an NDA

Refuse if someone asks you to sign an NDA before hearing their idea. NDAs are for people with real IP to protect, they're more reasonable if you're contracting with a large corporation and the deal includes payment.

Refuse an NDA that has a non-compete attached unless the non-compete was mentioned upfront and consideration is attached. This is firmly, "refuse outright or get a lawyer to make it palatable". If they refuse to compensate you for the period of the non-compete or to deal with a lawyer, walk.
