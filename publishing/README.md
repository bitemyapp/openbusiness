# Publishing agreements

Most of the text is written with authors in mind.

## Revenue vs. profit

Beware publishing agreements whose royalty assignments are based on profit rather than revenue.

## Copyright assignment

Most publishers will want the copyright assigned to them for virtually all media that could be relevant (digital, audio, print). It may be possible to avoid this and instead license the rights to print the content but I don't think this is an option for most authors. *Make certain there's no way the copyright can be kept in limbo!*
