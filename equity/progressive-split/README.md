# Progressive equity split

As announced and introduced [here](http://blog.detour.com/introducing-progressive-equity/)

## Explanation

Let's say you're the founder and you own about 50% - in a normal company, you'd get 500 megadonks. But under the Progressive Equity program, everything above the financial independence threshold gets "taxed" at 50% - you keep half, and the other half is redistributed back to employees, pro rata. So in our example, you'd get the first 50 megadonks outright and half of the other 450, for a total of 275 megadonks, and the other 225 would be redistributed to employees. So if you had 225 employees, on average each would get a megadonk. The cool thing about this is that employee percent ownership increases as the value of the company increases - natural incentive alignment.

## Progressive Equity Program FAQ

### What are the actual mechanics of how it works?

The employee equity pool is divided into two equal pieces - a normal RSU pool and a "Progressive" RSU pool. Employee grants are equal portions from each pool. The value of an employee's Progressive RSUs cap out at 50% of the financial independence number - so they basically stop appreciating while the other 50% of normal RSUs continue to appreciate, creating the same effect of a 50% tax.

There's a third "Kicker Pool" for the redistribution that starts at nothing and is fed as employees cross over the financial independence number.

### Does the program apply to investors?

No - it's designed so investors remain unaffected, but you're welcome to try and get them to opt-in.

### How does the redistribution actually happen?

It's a one-time event triggered by a large secondary, sale, or IPO. After that event, the whole progressive equity thing goes away and you go back to a more typical equity grant process.

### Can employees opt out?

No. But for what it's worth, in our experience, no one wants to. The financial independence number is high enough that only awful people that you shouldn't hire anyway would be concerned about being taxed above it. And the vast majority of employees will only benefit from it - most likely, it will only reduce the worth of the founders.

### What if an employee leaves before the redistribution happens?

Then they don't participate in the redistribution / kicker pool.
